\section{Membership}
\label{membership}
Membership will be divided into two subsections: Rensselaer Electric Vehicle General Members and Rensselaer Electric Vehicle volunteers.

\subsection{General Membership}
\label{membership:general}
A REV General Member must be a Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute student and fulfil the requirements outlined in the Rensselaer Electric Vehicle Bylaws.

General Members have the right to vote, are eligible to run for an office, and can be appointed to a Lead position. Voting rights include the ability to place a vote during election votes and general team policy votes, but not to propose voting matters.

\subsection{Volunteer Membership}
\label{membership:volunteer}
REV Volunteers do not have to be students at RPI. A volunteer will gain the same experience as a General Member and be considered as part of the team. REV Volunteers will not have the eligibility to be in office or be appointed a Lead position.

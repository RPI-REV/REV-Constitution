\section{Team Roles \& Election Process}
\label{roles}
The Officer roles are
\begin{itemize}
\item President
\item Project Manager
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Election Process}
\label{roles:process}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The annual election and appointment of officers shall be held five weeks before the end of Spring semester at a General Body Meeting
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item  In the event that the Teamâ€™s Competition is scheduled to be held two weeks before of the stated election date, it shall be moved backwards one week of the competition
    \end{enumerate}
\item The GBM in which elections are being held must have time allocated before the vote to allow Candidate running to present a speech with a maximum length of five minutes. Candidates will speak in alphabetical order.
\item After all Members wishing to run have spoken, the floor will be open for general discussion and questions directed towards those running.
\item After all candidates have spoken, any Member may speak about the Candidates for a maximum of two minutes.
\item The vote for each position is taken by Members writing down whom they wish to vote for and the position to elect them to on a sheet of paper. The President collects these papers and tallies the votes. If a tie exists between candidates who receive the most votes, the candidates that are not tied will be dropped from the ballot. The remaining candidates will have another chance to briefly talk, then a re-vote will be taken. If a tie persists, Kristin Sechrest (949-395-6461 as of 2/28/15) will be permitted to cast a vote to break the tie. In the event Kristin Sechrest has passed or an answer is not obtained in 4 hours of the election, a coin flip will break the tie. 
\item Two General Body Meetings before the election, all REV Members will be informed by the President, via email, of
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The positions available to be run for
    \item A description and the responsibilities of each position
    \item The requirements for candidacy of the position
    \item The date, time, and place the election will be held
    \end{enumerate}
\item If there is only one candidate running for a position, a simple majority will be required for the candidate to be elected into office.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item  If a simple majority is not met, the eligible Members will be notified that they have the ability to run for the position.
    \item During the next week candidates will be collected and then the election for the contested position proceeds as normal at the next GBM
    \item If no volunteers appear the candidate must receive at least one vote in order to take office
    \item If no votes exist for the candidate the newly elected policy makers should appoint the successor. If there are no new policy makers, the previous holder of the contested position may appoint their successor

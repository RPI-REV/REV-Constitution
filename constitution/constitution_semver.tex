\section{Semantic Versioning}
\label{constitution_semver}

This document should be versioned according to the principles of Semantic Versioning. The version is given in $\text{MAJOR}.\text{MINOR}.\text{PATCH}$. When this document is updated in such a way that REV fundamentally changes how it works and would cause for immediate action, for example changing officers, the MAJOR number should be updated. If the way REV operates is changed, but requires no immediate action, the MINOR number should be changed. The PATCH number should be updated for grammatical errors or to make wording more clear. These numbers may exceed 9, so $5.13.0$ would be acceptable.

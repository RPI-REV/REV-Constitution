# REV :heart: Scrum

Implementing scrum in a traditional engineering environment.

## Introduction

In the past, REV has had a few major problems.

1. Lack of communication between GBM's
2. Lack of peer review on engineering items
3. Lack of general vision on projects

This document is proposing integrating the scrum framework into 
REV to overcome these issues. This _will_ require a major version 
bump of the REV constitution, and will be an amendment. In addition to
changing the constitution, it will also require several new tools
integrated into the REV workflow to facilitate scrum and the new
agile development tequiniques we adopt.

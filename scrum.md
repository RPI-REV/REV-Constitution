# REV :heart: Scrum

Implementing scrum in a traditional engineering environment.

## Introduction

In the past, REV has had a few major problems.

1. Lack of communication between GBM's
2. Lack of peer review on engineering items
3. Lack of general vision on projects

This document is proposing integrating the scrum framework into 
REV to overcome these issues. This _will_ require a major version 
bump of the REV constitution, and will be an amendment. In addition to
changing the constitution, it will also require several new tools
integrated into the REV workflow to facilitate scrum and the new
agile development tequiniques we adopt.

## Scrum

### Idealology

> Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products...
>
> The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, 
> and rules. Each component within > the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential
> to Scrumâ€™s success and usage.

Scrum hold itself to three "pillars"

- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

Each of these pillars defeats one the problems REV has had.

#### Transparency

> Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. 
> Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share 
> a common understanding of what is being seen.
>

This addresses the issue of communication in REV. There have been many times where the average
member may have been doing some small, fairly trivial task _without_ asking anyone else 
about how it interfaces with the rest of the product, or even it's final application!
Situations like these often create issues where significant portions of work have to be
redone, or future work must deviate from the plan. In these scenarios, our team hinders 
itself from delivering a product effectively.

#### Inspection

> Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a 
> Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances...  Inspections are most beneficial 
> when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at the point of work.

As a team, we have always prided ourselves upon the fact that _we_ design our cars. 
Unfortunately, in the past few years our indepences has become one of our greatest downfalls.
Facing the facts, we as a team have failed at keeping our own work to a certain quality.
It is time we begin to act as our own QA team, and leave our blind faith in our members behind.
Scrum emphasizes incremental inspection of our own work, and hollding ourselves responsible for it.
Properly implmenting this will require a few factors, namely _peer design review_, and _testing_.

#### Adaptation

> If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, 
> and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed 
> must be adjusted.

The REV of 2014-2015 was a perfect example of failing in plain sight. Plans changed quickly, and 
desicions for the product were not made by the right people, causing issues to propogate across the 
team, resulting in a half-baked product. There is an urgent need for centeral mangement of the 
product on the team, and scrum so elegently incorperates it.
